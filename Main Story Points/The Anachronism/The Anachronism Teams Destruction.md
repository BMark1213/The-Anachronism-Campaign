[[Zatana Wynlana]]


[[Virna (Time)

[[Willow Crassus




Once the team had collected all the stones they preformed a ritual to summon back [[The Warden]]. The Warden was pleased to see Zatana and happy she had fulfilled her mission. [[The Warden]] then explained to the rest of the team that the stones would reset the universe and they would cease to exist. Zatana would be kept alive to watch over the new universe along side the Warden. Zatana did not know this was the case the whole time. Everyone on the team protested and attempted to take them gems back from the warden. The Warden did not allow them to do this and froze them all in place. All except Zatana. He looked at Zatana and said, "Whos side are you on?" Zatana looked at the Warden and then looked at her friends. They had been together for years fighting along side each other searching for the artifacts making new friends, at this point they were a family. And Zatana would do anything to protect her family. Zatana looked back to the Warden an drew her sword. He looked at her with saddened eyes and said, "So be it." At this moment they all unfroze and drew their weapons. They all were enveloped in red lightning and brought to a place called [[The Battlefield of Time]]. This is where the biggest battle in the universe started, [[The Warden]] vs. [[The First Anachronism Team]]. There they fought the Warden and eventually were able to ruin the ritual of the artifacts causing them all to be shot off into different time lines all 7 relating to each person who knocked it off:

Ocean Blue: [[Elman 'The Shadow' Holt
Desert Yellow: Unknown
Forest Green: [Willow Crassus]
Psychic Purple: [[Zatana Wynlana
Icey Blue: [[Aisling The Elf Queen
Void Black: Unknown
Magma Red: [[Virna (Time)

Once this had happened the Warden flew into a rage. He then forced Zatana against the wall and held her there. The Warden then forced the others to there knees in a line in front of Zatana. He then said, "I expected more out of you Zatana. Attachments only lead to failure. That's the funny thing about friends isn't it. The more you love them the more it hurts when they go." The Warden then took a deep breath, looked at Zatana, raised his sword, and said, "Allow me to demonstrate." Then the Warden killed each individual team member as they all looked into Zatana's eyes. Zatana, physically unable to speak just cried. First went [[Elman 'The Shadow' Holt, then [Willow Crassus], then [[Aisling The Elf Queen, and lastly [[Virna (Time). The Warden then smiled at Zatana and said, "You will learn." As each of them died their soul went with the artifact that they had removed. 

Zatana so full of rage was able to break free from the Wardens spell and lunged a him. She laid a slice so powerful on his left eye it left a scar. He felt the blood rush down his face and smiled even harder. As Zatana went for another lunge The Warden just disappeared. And the battle field began to crumble at Zatana's feet. Zatana was left with no one in the middle of an infinite wasteland with nothing but a compass to lead her back home.
