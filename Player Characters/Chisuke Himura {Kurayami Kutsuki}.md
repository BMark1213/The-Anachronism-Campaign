[[Steampunk Earth 966]]

Kurayami Kutsuki (Chisuke Himura) was born in the city of [[Rale]] and doesn’t have anyone he considers family. He has a mom ([[Emica Kutsuki]]), a dad ([[Chikao Kutsuki]]), and a brother ([[Akira Kutsuki]]), but he never felt like he belonged to anybody nor did he grow up with anybody to look up to. He was poor and his home life was rough as his mother would abuse him and he had developed severe anger issues, impulsive behaviors, and mood swings. He found music as an escape, or a way to distract himself. He would try his best to stay away from home for long periods of time and ended up getting involved with the wrong people. He looked to violence and theft to earn money and/or exert his emotions. His brother was much more accepted into the family than he ever was and felt like a punching bag, or a good for nothing in his family. His anger and impulsivity increasingly worsened as did the abuse from his mother. He also started to go insane, having constant thoughts of violence and fantasizing about running away. He developed a plan when he was 14, knowing he’d need a way to adopt a whole new identity…

Today’s the day bitches, I’m not a coward, so now is when I choose to remove myself from this shitty place. Tonight when the sun sets and it becomes dark, I'm killing “Cassius.” I have a few guys helping me and I’m making sure none of them know what my face looks like. Alr peace.

Ima kill him, hopefully the police are stupid and I can frame it as a suicide and I can just be a missing persons case or some shit.

It's been a few days since I killed Cassius, and the police have me in the newspaper for fraud and attempted murder. These dumbasses won’t ever find me though because I have someone who’s willing to switch places for a bit of shimmer. His name is “Chisuke.”

Officially roaming the streets as Chisuke Himura, finding a city to stay in for a day or two, I can't stay in one place for too long.

This gang with glowing blue stones helped me w/ directions to a nearby city. I pick-pocketed the young one because I thought the stones were interesting. They were super suspicious people.

My daggers are dull af, what the shit. Got into a street fight over some chips. I won, now I’m on my way and it looks like the case has died down in Rale, maybe…

I got a new guitar :3 (I stole it at a mini market in the middle of nowhere, no literally it's all trees and mountain)

It’s been 3 months, and I’ve seen a total of 7 Athebus police. Can’t risk anything so I sliced their throats. :3
