Patch Remington was born in the city of [[Phospheu]], 1971 to [[Rosalie Perberos]] and [[Jasper Perberos]]. The town is rumored by its inhabitants to be haunted, but below the surface, there’s something deeper going on. Patch knows this, and has never been scared to welcome the town into his heart as it is. Phosphaeu has given him everything. Because his parents frequently argue, Patch is always out of the house, usually exploring the uncharted parts of town or studying at the library. 

Patch’s mother, Rosalie, is part of an Underground Wizardry Committee, unbeknownst to her husband or son--or anyone. The committee moves in secret, though some rebels like to use their magic to trick people or get what they want. When she and Jasper start to argue in public, Rosalie tries to love-spell him, but a rivaling wizard member catches and seizes her. Instantly, she is taken to the rivaling group’s base after the wizard erases the memory of all their witnesses. 

Confused and suddenly in-love, Jasper tries to find Rosalie, leaving Patch home alone, forgotten. Jasper doesn’t sleep. He asks everyone around him where she might have gone, and follows his gut to the rivaling wizard’s base. Unrecognizable to the group, he is questioned, then promptly killed. 

Patch is left orphaned, alone, and scared at the age of 15. Suddenly, the town that had made him rich with wonder has taken everything from him too. Months later, scheming his way through life, using only his boyish wit, clever resourcefulness, and undeniable charm to survive. Now 16 years old, he is picked up by a group of pirates known as [[The Blue Hawk]]. They ask Patch if he would join their crew

Faced with the option of leaving his magically enticing town behind, or being guaranteed survival on the open sea, headed to who-knows-where, but with strength in numbers, Patch hesitates before agreeing to go with them. 

Although questioning the logic and morality of his captain, he carries on anyway. The rest of the crew is not so kind to him seeing as he is young and new to the pirate life, but he fits in well enough. He spends months on the ship, never quite perfecting the craft, but trying hard at it. His intelligence, decorum, and charm make up for his clumsiness and lack of skill. Unwilling to speak up against the captain, he keeps his thoughts to himself, wondering every day if he made the right choice. He wonders if his mom ever came home to find both her husband and son gone, but decided to put that behind him. Patch would be lying if he said he wasn’t angry with her for leaving, without a goodbye. It gnaws at him; the unknown. Still, he is kind to a fault and clings his innocence--the one thing he has left from Rosalie and Jasper Remington, and Phosphaeu, Canada.
