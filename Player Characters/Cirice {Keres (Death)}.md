Cirice, born Keres (kae-⟨r⟩es) (Death), was the daughter of a ruthless demon belonging to the 9th circle of [[Hell 397832]], [[Sin]]. This demon, though powerful, was not a ruler of Nessus, but had close connections to Asmodeus. Her siblings: [[Wicus (Conquest)]], [[Edith (War)]], and [[Wanjala (Famine)]] were antagonistic toward her. 

Keres was her mother’s prodigy, the only sibling to inherit her talent in sorcery and necromancy. From birth, her mother only saw her as a thing, a weapon with no name or importance that she could mold to her every need. Through years and years of psychological conditioning, she did her bidding, but not willingly. After years of consciously acting as her mother’s mercenary, one particular kill sent her over the edge. She was forced to kill her own sibling, Wanjala. Upon her 18th birthday as a “graduation ceremony”, in the dark of night, she snuck up on her brother and cast an intense spell that killed him on the spot. This not only broke her spirit but also her power making her weaker. At this point, she knew she would no longer do her mother's bidding and she would escape. After realizing that the only way she could really escape her mother’s grasp was through becoming someone else entirely, she adopted the name Cirice. She left everything behind and narrowly escaped from hell by using the last of her power to open a gate to the [[The Original Timeline 1692]]. 
  
She changed her appearance as much as she could, darkened her hair, got new clothes, and a mask that covered the lower half of her face to go along to ensure her new identity would be safe. However she came to the conclusion that the only real talent she had that was worthy of making a living out of was her talent for crime, she reverted back into a mercenary, but now free from the grasp of her mother she didn’t limit herself to assassin work, most of her work lied in conning, swindling, and stealing, using her sorcery as an aid.



In the year 1692, at the very beginning of the Salem Witch Trials, Cirice managed to set up a home in Salem, Massachusetts. The whole time Cirice was on the material plane she had kept her powers hidden. Cirice was good at disguising herself due to her mother's rigorous training. She did not know where she had received this mask but she carried it around with her and wore it as a disguise. 

Later that year, her world came crashing down around her. She had become friends with her neighbor, an old man named [[Samuel Whitlock]]. One day when they were out walking together Samuel collapsed unexpectedly. Cirice tried everything to save him and eventually, she resorted to her magic. She cast a powerful spell that not only healed him but turned him a bit younger. Samuel was very grateful for what she did and promised to tell no one. However, someone nearby had seen the incident occur and reported it to the authorities. Cirice was sentenced to be burned at the stake. As she was walking to the town center to be burned she saw Samuel and gestured for him to come towards her. They talked for a bit and as a thank you for everything he did for her she gave him [[Wanjala’s Ring]] which would help him in case he was in trouble. Cirice was tied to a wooden stake in the center of town and lit ablaze for everyone to see. However, due to her fire resistance, she was able to break free and narrowly escaped with her life. This only fueled the hatred and vitriol the people had towards her, she once again was forced to run away.
