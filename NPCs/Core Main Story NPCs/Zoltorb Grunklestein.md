Zoltorb grew up in [[Post Apocalyptic 3564]] that was destroyed by a magical nuke no other information was known. until he made it his mission to discover what happened he found an abandoned bunker of an old artificer. When he walked down the stairs he came upon a sign that stated,”[[Gwydion’s Bunker]]”. Gwydion was the smartest man of all time and the person who built the “Artificer Bomb.” Gwydion’s soul and arcana still lived inside his creations. 

Zoltorb became the most knowledgeable on the arcane and the history of the  “Burning Skies Event.” Although he was the smartest in the land he didn't have the resources to advance his inventions so he would bounce from party to party in order to gain funding for his creation but would leave whenever they lost their use to him this worked for a while until he messed with the wrong person one of his parties ended up falling victim to the King of the wasteland also known as Lunarse the Tyrant of the Fallen Skies, a barbarian who took advantage of the apocalypse. Lunarse was able to create The Fallen Skies Empire. Although Zoltorb was intelligent in the mystics of the arts and machine but Lunarse was a whole different monster he was an amazing tactician and manipulator who ended up ruling half the apocalyptic world he was the most tactically intelligent in the whole land claiming the largest amount of territories when Zoltorb's party fell he became a slave to the people running [[The Scavenging Division]]. He worked there until one day he was able to amass enough scrap to build a robot to help him escape. Using a combination of stealth and wits he made it out, but his live wasn't the only thing he got away with. They also stole the "[[Heart of the Dessert]]" from Lunarse. This was the power source Zoltorb finally needed to complete his project. Now Zoltorb has been hiding in the Artificers bunker as Lunarse and his goons go in search of the heart of the desert.
