Best friend that they lost: Willow Crassus

Zoltorb and Willow were running from a gang they had just stolen from and Willow had fallen off a cliff Zoltorb caught her by the hand of her robotic arm and as he was trying his hardest to pull her up, the arm that he made her came off her body and she fell to her death.

At the hunt, Zoltorb meets Willow. He doesnâ€™t know it's her. During the hunt, she loses her arm. They had previously come across the necrotic limb-regrowing tree. Zoltorb has a choice to give them the regrowing tree limb or to give her, her original robotic arm back. If he gives the arm and puts it on her he will get a flashback that she himself put the arm on Willow in the past timeline or he will get a flashback of himself holding the arm above the cliff where Willow fell. He will also gain a level at this point and so will her character.
