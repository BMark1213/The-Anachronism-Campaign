Captain of [[The Apocrypha]]



Elman was like a father to Patch
  

They had both come from the town of Phosphaeu and everyone on the crew is an outcast or is different in some way.


Elman taught Patch everything he knew about leaving his old life behind and becoming one with the pirates. Patch found his family on the ship. His old ship that is. Elman was fated to die in a battle to save Patch's home town and did die there. Patch held him as he passes ultimately winning the fight for the town.
