[[The Anachronism Teams Creation]]

[[Zatana Wynlana]]


Originally from [[Phospheu]]

Captain of [[The Apocrypha]]



Elman was like a father to TJ
  

They had both come from the town of Phosphaeu and everyone on the crew is an outcast or is different in some way.


Elman taught TJ everything he knew about leaving his old life behind and becoming one with the pirates. TJ found his family on the ship. His old ship that is. Elman was fated to die in a battle to save TJs home town and did die there. TJ held him as he passes ultimately winning the fight for the town.
