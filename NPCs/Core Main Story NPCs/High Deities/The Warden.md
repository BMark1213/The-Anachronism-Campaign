Created [[The Anachronism Tavern]] for Zatana to create a team of people to protect the multiverse. This team was called The Anachronism Team


[[Instability]]

Evil and Good were able to create Balance (The Warden) but not only did they create balance but they also created Instability. These siblings were told by their parent to fight to the death in order to decide who gets to watch over the universe. They did so. In their fight to the death pieces of their essence were discarded into the timeline creating Gods. These Gods included: 

[[Elysara (Goddess of Spirit)]]
[[Xyphera (Goddess of Fire)]]
[[Lumidos (God of Water)]]
[[Vestarean (God of Earth)]]
[[Xypheros (God of Air)]]
