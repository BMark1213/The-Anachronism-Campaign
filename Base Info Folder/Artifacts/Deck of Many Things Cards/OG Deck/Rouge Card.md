A nonplayer character of the DM's choice becomes [Hostile](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Mysterious%20Islands#h-Hostile) toward you. The identity of your new enemy isn't known until the NPC or someone else reveals it. Nothing less than a wish spell or [Divine Intervention](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Cleric#h-Divine%20Intervention) can end the NPC's hostility toward you.
