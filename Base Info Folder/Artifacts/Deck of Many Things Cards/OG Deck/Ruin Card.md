All forms of [Wealth](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Equipment#h-Wealth) that you carry or own, other than magic [items](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Southlands%20Player%27s%20Guide#h-items), are lost to you. Portable property vanishes. [Businesses](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Recurring%20Expenses#h-Businesses), buildings, and land you own are lost in a way that alters reality the least. Any documentation that proves you should own something lost to this card also disappears.
