Deepest Desire:

I guess Vera’s greatest desire would be some one to love. It’s kinda cheesy but one of her flaws is seeing the good in everyone so finding someone healthy is hard. She is very affectionate towards everyone which in turn causes people to think the wrong way. So with past experiences and relationships she hasn’t really opened her head to anyone. She wants someone that understands her and won’t hurt her or take advantage of her.


###### Backstory 

You were a 12 year old amnesiac who woke up in this town full of Elves and other magical beings. all you could remember was your name. Typically this town didn’t let in any outsiders let alone live there. You were just an average kid. But you were always out of the ordinary due to the fact that you weren’t from this city. This mayoral family the Agran’s took you in and you got along with them well. It was never like you were part of the family more just like you were their kid Nasir’s best friend. The father of your friend was the leader of the tribe. He agreed to teach you and his daughter how to cast Druidic magic that can let you connect to the gods. Over years you ended up building your own house in the village and living on your own at like 17 making a name for yourself but still learning from who the town called the Father Nature.  You being an outsider this was a great honor. The town started to grow a likening to you. In the next couple of years. The Father Nature passed away and you and his son gave him a sort of Viking funeral. Once that happened a dark green swirling light came around both of you. For you it created a staff in your hand and for Nasir a grassy broad sword and a snake on his neck.  You had gained his powers over plants and healing and Nasir gained his powers over animals and his intelligence for battle strategy. You became the towns greatest healer and you were well renowned across the land. However the things you would do were only the stuff you learned you were never able to tap into the power you knew you had gained after his death. One day you had to leave town to gain a rare plant. Once you came back and saw that the town was under siege against a gang of many pirates you ran back into town just in time to see Nasir have the head pirates rapier pierced into his heart. You ran over just in time to catch him falling. He looked in your eyes and said “Vera I’ve always loved you. Now you need to run they came to town looking for you.” As you were about to say something he cut you off and said. “You have to go now!” And as he said this his snake slithered onto your neck. You listened and began to run. As you ran you turned back to see Nasir let out an immense blast of light creating a wall of thorns and vines encasing the town. The pirates fled and you stayed in hiding with your adopted mother for days. Eventually you came out of hiding and held a funeral for Nasir and your adoptive mother become the leader of the tribe. You guys spent months rebuilding the town together.
