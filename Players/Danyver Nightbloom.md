[[Vestarean (God of Earth)]]


Has snake the snake who is her mother


Deepest Desire:

I guess Vera’s greatest desire would be some one to love. It’s kinda cheesy but one of her flaws is seeing the good in everyone so finding someone healthy is hard. She is very affectionate towards everyone which in turn causes people to think the wrong way. So with past experiences and relationships she hasn’t really opened her head to anyone. She wants someone that understands her and won’t hurt her or take advantage of her.
