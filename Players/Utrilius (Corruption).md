Demi God Child of [[Xyphera (Goddess of Fire)]]


---

When hell was created Xyphera created a queen in order to have someone to rule over hell with. This being was known as Sin. The two together had 5 children: Famine, War, Conquest, Time, and Death). These 5 children were made as protectors of the top ring of hell in order for no one to enter or exit the rest of the 9 layers. Sin being a a god creation only had half of Xyphera’s power. In having children together Xyphera and Sin were able to create 3/4 gods (Mythborn/Triblood). These beings had immense power making them nearly unstoppable. Sin eventually bored of ruling tasked the 5 children to rule. For a long time these beings lived in relative harmony. That was until Edith, war, craved for more power. 


Open on Trill’s Story:

Utrilius was the youngest of the Four Horseman but he was also the smartest. Tril spent most of his time in his room that he turned into a lab building things. Tril was often Hell’s weapon supplier along with making very powerful weapons for his siblings. Tril also often had ambition to control the whole of hell but realized it was just in his nature and not in his actual want. (Unless it is what he actually wants you lmk)


One day Tril was his workshop trying to cool down post fight with Edith who kept asking him to make her weapons to gain power over Wanjala’s door. Edith was asking this because she didn’t believe Wanjala couldn’t protect the door because of a recent attack that almost let out some of hells most dangerous beings. Tril had been working on a weapon on a plethora of weapons specifically ones that would make it so he would never have to guard his door again. However knowing Edith vied for more power Tril refused to give her any weapons to use against her own siblings. Edith exited Tril’s room in a rage. Tril went back to working on the project he was currently working on. 

Tril had been working for months on necklaces for himself and each of his siblings that when worn would amplify their power 50 fold. Tril had just managed to finish them when he heard yelling coming from downstairs. Tril ran down as quickly as he could leaving all of his work lying on his desk. As he ran down he quickly put on a ring that could make him invisible in order to watch without getting involved. When he went down he say Wanjala and Edith fighting in the courtyard. The two were hurling spells at each other and destroying everything around them. Luckily Tril had put a spell on the house that would being it back to perfect condition. Tril went to turn back and go to his room and thats when he realized his ring was missing. He looked up and saw Dearil holding all three of the remaining necklaces. He then passed them to the other siblings who caught them and put them on. Edith then proclaimed, “Time to finally figure out who is the true ruler.” Then they all lunged at each other going into an all out brawl. The fight lasted barely minutes until the all threw a punch at the same time causing their fists to connect at once and their necklaces to hit eachother. This caused an explosion bigger than a nuke could ever create. The explosion caused the entire top layer of hell to become a post apocalyptic waste land. The only surviving structure was the rulers mansion. After the explosion the siblings looked around for the mother with her nowhere to be found.

As time passed Edith took the mantle as the ruler due to the fact that the four horseman were at war and she was the embodiment of it. Tril’s Door was taken by Edith and Wanjala’s door was taken by Dearil. Tril now roams the streets of this wasteland hoping that one day he may find a way to fix everything he lost.

Deepest Desire:

To have his homeland not at war and also siblings that wouldn’t like to kill home. Also to be able to spend time learning more about building different things/creating more things
