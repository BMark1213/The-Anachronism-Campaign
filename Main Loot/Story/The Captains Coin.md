Youâ€™re getting the captains coin. Used 2 times per long rest and you can flip it and if you get heads you get advantage tails disadvantage. You can reverse the affects by calling tails while you flip it. In that case tails would be advantage and heads disadvantage. Takes a bonus action to use it.
