You posses a thin dagger that seems to be made of shadows you can hold. Once per long rest you may throw this dagger and have a chance of teleporting to where it is thrown. This dagger is held as a magical bracelet on your wrist that you can control to appear as the dagger. When the dagger is thrown you must make a dc 13 DEX saving throw in order for the teleport to work.

If the dagger is repaired the jump works every time.
