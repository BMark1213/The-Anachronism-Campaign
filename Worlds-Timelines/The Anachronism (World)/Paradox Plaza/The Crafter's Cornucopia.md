#Shop 
[[Paradox Plaza]]

**Shopkeeper:** Gilda Gearfiddle, a sprightly halfling with a knack for finding the rarest of materials and a passion for supporting crafts of all kinds. Her shop is her adventure, and she loves to share stories about how she acquired her most peculiar items.

**Description:** The shop is a wonderland of shelves, bins, and barrels, each brimming with materials ranging from the mundane to the mystic. The air smells of metal, wood, and a hint of magic. Items are not always labeled in the most organized manner, but Gilda knows exactly where everything is and is more than happy to guide her customers through her vast inventory.
