#Shop 
[[Paradox Plaza]]

**Shopkeeper:** Iskandar Gearspark, a gnome with an insatiable curiosity and an inventive genius. He's always tinkering with something, and his eyes sparkle with the thrill of a new creation. Iskandar loves to demonstrate his latest inventions, often with explosive results.

**Description:** The shop is a chaotic blend of workshop and showroom, with inventions and gadgets of all kinds cluttering the space.
