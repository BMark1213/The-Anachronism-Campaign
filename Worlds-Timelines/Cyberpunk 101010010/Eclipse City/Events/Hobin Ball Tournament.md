## Hobin-Ball Rules

For this version of Hobin-Ball, teams **aren't allowed to use weapons or wear armor**. Instead, have players use the 10 + DEX modifier rule to calculate their AC. This better represents the ability to dodge in this dodgeball-like game, and also evens the playing field so that paladins/fighters aren't untouchable. One team starts on left end of the field, the other on the right. They can pick any platform to stand on, so long as it's within three rows of their end of the field. Each team gets one ball, given to the player of their choice. Roll initiative.

**IF YOU HAVE A BALL YOU MUST PASS OR THROW IT ON YOUR TURN**

Run Hobin-Ball like a combat. On a player's turn, **they can move and take one action**. There are no bonus actions in Goat-Ball. Here are the available actions:


### Moving

Movement in Goat-Ball consists of leaping from one platform to another. A player gets 10ft of movement, or hopping to the closest platform, for free. They can continue to jump up to their movement speed after that, but must make an Athletics check of DC 13. Success means they nailed the jump and can continue their turn as normal. Failure ends their turn immediately, as they spend the rest of it trying to stay balanced. Multiple players cannot be on the same platform.

### Throwing The Ball

A player holding a goat ball can throw it by making an attack roll. The range is maximum 50ft. This roll doesn't take into account proficiency, and so is a d20 + STR modifier roll. On a miss the ball falls, and the target takes possession of the ball.

On a hit, the target must make an Acrobatics saving throw of DC 10 + the difference between the attack roll and the target's AC. For instance, say Peppy the gnome hits Goliath Johnson with a 15. Goliath Johnson has an AC of 10, so Peppy's attack was greater by 5. Goliath Johnson would need to succeed on a DC 15 (10 + 5) Acrobatics check or be knocked off his platform. Failing this saving throw means being knocked off and taken out of the game.

If the attack hits and knocks the target off, the attacker gets possession of the ball again. If the attack hits and the target isn't knocked off, the player nearest the target gets possession of the ball.


### Passing

Instead of attacking, a player may choose to pass the ball to a teammate they feel is in a better position. By using their action, a player with the ball can toss it to another player within 40ft. The other player is assumed to catch without needing a roll. However, a player who failed a movement check is too busy balancing and can't accept a pass.


### Dodging

Players might want to prepare for a throw from the other team. To do so, they can use the Dodge action. this imposes disadvantage on attack rolls against them until their next turn.

### Spell Casting

You can cast spells as you could in any other combat.


## Winning Hobin-Ball

Play continues like combat, going turn-by-turn, until all of one team's players are knocked off their platforms. The team left standing is the victor. If the game ends too quickly for your taste, or the players enjoyed it a lot, feel free to make it a best two-out-of-three match.
