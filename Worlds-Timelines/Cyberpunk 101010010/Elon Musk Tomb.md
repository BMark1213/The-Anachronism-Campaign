### Entrance Room:

You look around to see that you need four colored gems to put into the statues to open that last door. 

  
On the sides of the room are four separate puzzle doors

  
  

### Room 1:
  

Blood Wall 

  

The party enters a room with a stone wall and a locked door. The wall has a riddle engraved in it; "Use your head to paint me red, inside of thee resides your key. Be aware of what you spurn, for what you give shall be returned." There is a Basin in front of the wall that has four circles on it. 

  

After each player puts their blood into it a gem lights up. 

The party must use the blood and smear it on the wall(where they get it from is up to them), and a duplicate of what the blood came from emerges out of the wall. The party must fight and defeat the duplicate to unlock the door.

Get the Red M

  

### Room 2:

  

A Matter of Perspective 

  

The party arrives in a circular room, in which there are 8 pressure plates surrounding what appears to be a pile of rubble. The 8 pressure plates are situated in the directions of a compass and the stone floor has been carved in such a way that stone grooves flow from the pressure plate to the center of the room where the rubble is. 

  

Across from the door they entered s a large set of double doors, which reads "It's all a matter of perspective." And it has three pedestals to the right of the door. To the left of the door is a wall full of bottles with different things in them. 

  
  

When players interact with the pressure plates, it causes the rubble to float into the air. Players will notice that the rubble is forming words. However, each player sees something completely different. Despite each player seeing something different, there is a theme. (Ex. Player One sees dew, Two sees river, Three sees ice, Four sees mist. Theme: water/liquids) When players identify/say the theme and place the bottles of the theme on each pedestal, the double doors at the opposite end will open. 

  

Themes: Space, Transportation, and Birds

  

Bottle of Nebula, Bottle of Oil, Bottle with a feather in it

  

There are three levers on the wall of the hallway where they enter.

  

Number 1 is down, Number 2 is up, Number 3 is up

  

When one is down the other two go up. 

  

These change the word theme. 

  

The three pedestals have the numbers 1,2,3 engraved in the front of them.

  

Pedestal right before the door in which the theme objects must be placed.

### Room 3:

  

One of my favorite ones, got the idea for this from a puzzle in Critical Role, re-adapted it for my campaign;

  

The Lockpick's Door

  

(This is a red herring. It's Theives Cant describing whatever's inside the room, you can be as subtle or as blatant as you like if you have a rogue) and what looks like seven locks with various writings on it. There is a thick iron turning handle in the center of the door.

  

The first lock says "Open" in Common.

  

The second lock says "Close" in Elvish.

  

The third lock says "Open" in Dwarvish.

  

The fourth lock says "Close" in Infernal.

  

The fifth lock says "Open" in Giant.

  

The seventh lock says "Close" in Halfling.

  

The sixth lock says "Close" in Undercommon.

  

The objective of the puzzle is to unlock the locks which say "Open" (DC 10, or the trap goes off) and to leave the locks which say "Close" closed, and then turn the door handle, otherwise the Lightning Rune in the center of the hallway (or another trap of your design) activates. The challenge comes from the character's language limitations. Sometimes they will have to do some guess-work.

### Room 4:

  

The Greatest Weapon 

  

A room filled with various weapon racks and all sorts of different weapons surrounding a statue of a knight with an outstretched hand, and a plaque that says "Bring to me the greatest weapon, that kings covet, puts warriors to ruin, and ends all battles." Putting any weapon in the hand of the statue causes it to become an animated weapon that attacks. Among the weapons is a sword called "Peacemaker", Placing the olive branch (symbol for peace) in the hand of the statue solves the puzzle.

  

When the peacemaker sword is placed in the hand they’re eyes of the statue glow and the knight come to life and fight them with it, but when they defeat him, the sword will turn into an olive branch... the knight will reappear as inanimate as it was in the beginning and they will be able to place the olive branch in its hand.
