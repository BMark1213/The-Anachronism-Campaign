### Blue Royale Casino

A massive floating ship and casino that seems to be made of pure, glistening gold. Lights flash all around the casino, and when it reaches possible new players a narrow drawbridge stretches out from the entrance with lights also illuminating the sides, as if rolling out the red carpet. To the side is another entrance to a dressing room filled with countless different fancy outfits, as the Blue Royale seems to have a dress code- no pirate garb for its visitors. As soon as you enter is an immediate rush of excitement and adrenaline, the shape of the casino inside being hexagonal with not an inch of free space. The massive space is split into different attractions with a red carpet down the middle, and past a circular receptionist's desk is an elevator. After a very, very long ride in the elevator, there is another massive room filled with seats for an audience and a giant roulette table in the middle. A massive slide leads to another exit out of the ship. The Blue Royale is a seemingly perfect place to spend your gold, drink, eat, and play games, but in reality, it's... Well, just like any other casino, though on a much larger scale. The drinks within the casino cause its drinkers to hallucinate that the fish-headed employees are human, and the casino is designed to keep its players on the ship for as long as possible, while the players only feel as though they've been gambling for a much shorter amount of time. We see this, especially withÂ [Clorten](https://jrwishow.fandom.com/wiki/Clorten "Clorten"), who felt as though he was gambling for maybe a day or more when in reality, it had been 10 years since he entered.
