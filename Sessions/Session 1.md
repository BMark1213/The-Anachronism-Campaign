## Session Summary: 

The party is in the tattoo shop and proceeds to talk about the happenings around the town and what they are going to do. Cirice gets a magical tattoo of a demon and is imbued with some magic properties yet to be discovered. Maeve's friend offers to hack into the phone in exchange for some cash. They do so and the cash in the bank account is split amongst the party. The hacker then offers the party a job to break into A Tomb. The catch is the only person who can open it/has the key is a man named Professor X. They find that X resides on the top floor of the building at the center of the city. They also find out that the way to attract his attention is to win the Hobinball tournament that is happening in town due to the fact that he will be sponsoring the winning team.
