## Session Summary: 

Each player had run through their own motions before receiving a card that stated: “Something of yours has been taken. It is up to get it back. Be ready in one minute.“ They were all confused by this and prepared in their own way. Once the one minute was over they were all forcefully transported into [[The Anachronism Tavern]]. Each person sat there confused not saying anything to each other and all but TJ drew their weapons at each other. Zatana then shifts the table into a bar and fills up drinks for all them. All of the players introduce themselves to one another and Zatana introduces herself. Zatana explains why they are there and then shows them her past using her powers. She leads them to the ritual room and shows them the orb that holds [[The Anachronism (World)]] together. She instructs them as to what they are to do in [[Cyberpunk 101010010]] and pushes them into the portal without a warning. They all end up in the middle of a bustling city with a sign that says “[[Eclipse City]].” After being pushed around by passers by Cirice steals a device she does not really understand. They all go into a nearby alleyway. Zoltorb grabs the device from her hands and realizes it is a highly advanced cellphone. Zoltorb is able to hack into the cellphone and change all of the information to suit his needs. He learns the original owner of the phone is a man named [[NPCs/Side Story NPCs/Cyberpunk 101010010/Science Competition/Rilvaynnik]] who is an archeology student at a nearby academy. Chisuke then grabs a random passerby who seems to be a student. Chisuke holds back the student as the others begin to question him. He doesn’t agree to say anything until they let him go. Chrisclonk put a knife up to his neck but he till does not comply. He is persistent that he is not allowed to say anything about himself or the nature of his studies. He does not reveal his name but does reveal that he goes to [[Ravenwood University]]. He also explains that there are many Universities within the area seeing as this is one of the best city’s in the country. They are seen as a cultural hub. Rilv takes their phone and pulls up a map of the city on the phone and marks the locations of the main 3 universities. After this he goes on his way. The Players are left in the middle of the alley way with no direction as to where to go.
