## Session Summary: 

Each player had run through their own motions before receiving a card that stated: “Something of yours has been taken. It is up to get it back. Be ready in one minute.“ They were all confused by this and prepared in their own way. Once the one minute was over they were all forcefully transported into [[The Anachronism Tavern]]. Each person sat there confused not saying anything to each other and all but Path drew their weapons and they all proceeded to draw their weapons at one another. Zatana then shifts the table into a bar and fills up drinks for all them. All of the players introduce themselves to one another and Zatana introduces herself. Zatana explains why they are there and then shows them her past using her powers. She then gives each of them an Item that pertains to the person they have lost. She leads them to the ritual room and shows them the orb that holds [[The Anachronism (World)]] together. She instructs them as to what they are to do in [[Cyberpunk 101010010]] and pushes them into the portal without a warning. They all end up in the middle of a bustling city with a sign that says “[[Eclipse City]].” After being pushed around by passers by Cirice steals a device she does not really understand. They all go into a nearby alleyway. Varak grabs the device from her hands and realizes it is a highly advanced cellphone. Patch is able to hack into the cellphone and change all of the information to suit his needs. He learns the original owner of the phone is a man named [[Rilvaynnik]] who is an archeology student at a nearby academy. Cirice then grabs a random passerby who seems to be a student. Cirice holds back the student as the others begin to question him. He doesn’t agree to say anything until they let him go. Patch put a knife up to his neck but he till does not comply. He is persistent that he is not allowed to say anything about himself or the nature of his studies. He does not reveal his name but does reveal that he goes to [[Ravenwood University]]. He also explains that there are many Universities within the area seeing as this is one of the best city’s in the country. They are seen as a cultural hub. The man takes their phone and pulls up a map of the city on the phone and marks the locations of the main universities. After this he goes on his way. The Players are left in the middle of the alley way with no direction as to where to go. They then get attacked by a group of gang members called the [[Razor Runners]]. After fighting these gang members they interrogate the leader. This man tells them nothing. They eventually let him go after finding out that he is just a random member of no importance. They also take each members jacket. They then look up the Razer Runners to find out they are part of the local sports league and they are the lowest seed. This game is called Hobin ball. They also find out all the colleges around participate in this sport. They now blend in by each wearing the Razor Runner Jacket. After this Cirice flirts with a random women on the street who agrees to give her a ride to her tattoo shop if she can try out a new tattoo method. Cirice agrees and they get on her motorcycle and leave. Varak and Patch take the train over to the tattoo shop.
