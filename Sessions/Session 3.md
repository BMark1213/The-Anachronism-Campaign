## Session Summary: 

The Party gets ready to fight the Dark Ravens and while in the waiting room [[Cirice {Keres (Death)}]] gets poisoned. They play the game and are able to defeat the [[Dark Ravens]] with pure might and skill. While still in the arena Professor X walks out into the court and congratulates our plays and says that they should come to his office tomorrow morning at 9 am. They go back to the bar and celebrate with everyone there. Deltric heals Cirice and they begin to form and even closer bond. The Party goes to sleep in order to get ready for the Day ahead of them.
