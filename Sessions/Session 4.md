## Session Summary: 

The Party wakes up and prepares to go meet with X. They get a debriefing from [[Glaisa]] and she gives them a remote detonated steel wall and a layout of the office. They then go on a little shopping trip and buy some minor goods. They then go to [[The Tower]] and take out some of the guards in the elevator. They arrive at the top floor to see X in his chair turned around. Cirice sneakily placed the charge on the elevator door and the party prepared for a fight.
